					Our names are Samuel Samida-Pugh, Jared Schellenberg and McCartney Wade, we are 16 year old students with
					a passion and interest for science, specifically nuclear physics and the potential it has to change the
					world. On this website you will find information about us and our projects, an example being our demonstration
                    fusor pictured on the side and our current project; a
					Farnsworth Fusion Reactor. We have begun this project with hopes of completing fusion research in order to solve the 
					world's most pressing issue, global warming. As we now know, fossil fuels are harmful to the 
					environment and are an unsafe source of viable energy. Alternative methods to replace fossil fuels have 
					been brought up, with the most captivating being nuclear fusion, the process of smashing atoms together
					in order to produce energy. The project we have set out to construct is a Farnsworth Fusion Reactor, 
					which fuses two deuterium atoms together to form helium, along with neutrons and x rays. These subatomic 
					particles and rays produce energy, which if harnessed in a similar way that a fission reactor harnesses energy, 
					which is by heating water and creating steam to rotate a turbine, will sustain humanity with energy for millions 
					of years, as the fuel used in the fusor, deuterium, is abundant here on earth. Fusion energy is also much cleaner 
					than fission energy and leaves behind little to no nuclear waste. The downside to the fusor is that the energy 
					produced by it is a fraction of the energy needed to start the fusion reactions in the first place, we have yet 
					to "break even" and turn fusion into a useable energy source. The goal of this project is to conduct fusion
				    research towards how we might break even and solve the problem of sustainable, clean fusion energy. 
					Harnessing the power of the atom and using it to our needs is something that we have an ambition for 
					and we know that we carry the knowledge and persistence to complete this project.
